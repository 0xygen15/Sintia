For example, \"Never have I ever dressed up as Darth Vader and walked around the city.\"\n\nAny player who has done what the statement says bends one finger. When a player has five fingers bent, they must choose \"Truth\" or \"Dare\" by telling the host.\n\n<b>2. 'Truth or Dare':</b> /truth_or_dare\n\nThere are two modes of play: free choice and turn-based. In free choice mode, players choose whether to answer a truth question or complete a dare.
